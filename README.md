This is a copy of the group repo for my final project for COGS108: Data Science in Practice

Our project was on analyzing how different crime rates correlate with murder rates in the US, and if so, which crimes affect it the most. We sourced our data from the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) program. The main file of note is "FinalProjectGroup058Sp22.ipynb", which is a Jupyter Notebook that goes over all we did for our project.

Other than that, the checkpoints show how our project evolved to be this way. Originally, we had a different project on trying to analyze the correlation between the popularity of an endangered animal and the funding it receives for conservation efforts. However, due to a lack of data visible to the public, we were unable to proceed with this project. This led to us making a pivot to our final project on crime rates. Finally, the CSV files folders are just that: CSV files of the data we used.
